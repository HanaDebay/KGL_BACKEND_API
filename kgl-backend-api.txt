Your submission must include a fully functional Express server connected to a MongoDB database. The project structure must utilize modular routing with three distinct routers.
A. Architecture & Routing
You must implement the following three routers in your application:procurementRoutes: Handles all logic related to purchasing produce from dealers/farms.salesRoutes: Handles logic for both cash sales and credit/deferred sales.userRoutes: Handles user management and authentication.B. API Documentation
You must integrate Swagger (swagger-jsdoc/swagger-ui-express) to document your API endpoints.
The documentation should be accessible at a route (e.g., /api-docs) and clearly detail the request body, parameters, and response codes for every endpoint.
Functional Specifications Router 1: Procurement (/procurement)
Managers use this to record produce bought by KGL. Your API must accept and validate the following data fields:

Name of produce: Alpha-numeric.
Type of produce: Alphabetic characters only, minimum 2 characters, cannot be empty.
Date: Not empty.
Time: Time of produce.
Tonnage (kg): Numeric, minimum 3 digits (e.g., 100+), cannot be empty.
Cost (UgX): Numeric, minimum 5 digits, cannot be empty.
Dealer Name: Alpha-numeric, minimum 2 characters, cannot be empty.
Branch: The branch stocking the produce (Maganjo or Matugga).+1
Contact: Valid phone numbers.
Selling Price: The price to be sold at.
Router 2: Sales (/sales)
This router handles two types of transactions. You must distinguish between them in your database schema or endpoints.
1. Cash Sales
Fields: Produce name, Tonnage, Amount Paid (UgX, min 5 digits), Buyer's Name (Alpha-numeric, min 2 chars), Sales Agent Name (Alpha-numeric, min 2 chars), Date, and Time.
2. Credit/Deferred Sales
Target: Trusted buyers only.
Fields: Buyer Name (Alpha-numeric, min 2 chars), National ID (NIN) (Valid NIN format), Location (Alpha-numeric, min 2 chars), Contacts (Valid phone format), Amount Due (UgX, min 5 digits), Sales Agent Name, Due Date, Produce Name, Produce Type, Tonnage, and Dispatch Date.
Router 3: Users & Authentication (/users)
This router manages the staff (Managers and Sales Agents).
1. Login Endpoint
Create a specific route (e.g., /login) that accepts a username/email and password.
Logic: Check the database for the user.
Status 200: Return if the user exists.
Status 401: Return if the user does not exist.
2. User Management
Support creating users with roles (Manager vs. Sales Agent). Note that only Managers should be allowed to record procurement, and Sales Agents record sales.+1

Submission Guidelines
To submit your assignment, follow these strict guidelines:
Public Repository: Provide a link to a public GitHub repository containing your project code.
Project Organization: Your code must follow a clean, modular directory structure.  Separate your models, routers, and utility programs.
Environment Variables:
Do NOT commit your .env file containing actual secrets or database URIs.
DO include a .env.example file in the root of your repository. This file must contain a template of the expected environment variables
Example: .env.example
Your repository should include a file named .env.example that looks exactly like this (but with empty or dummy values):



# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Connection
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/karibu_groceries_db

# Authentication Secrets (if applicable)  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here


Grading Criteria:
Correct implementation of the 3-router architecture.
Proper use of the .env.example file and Git ignore rules.
Functionality of the Login (200/401) logic.
